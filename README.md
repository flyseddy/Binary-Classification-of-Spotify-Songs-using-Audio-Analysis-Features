## How it works
1. Click on the "Open in Colab" button
2. In Google Colab, Press "Runtime" -> "Run all"
3. My pre-trained model will output song predictions on the Test Set (Labeled) and User Generated Test Set (Unlabeled) based on my liked and disliked song data.

Note: 1 -> Liked Prediction; 0 -> Disliked Prediction
